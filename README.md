# Design of Algorithms assignment 2 
this assignment is split into 3 parts where each parts gets harder.
part 1 student is expected to write a heap tree 
part 2 student derives a variant of DAG using whatever algorithms to compute the shortest path
part 3 student are expected to come up with rotations  for binary search tree .
