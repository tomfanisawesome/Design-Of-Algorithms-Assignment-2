# Design of Algorithms assignment 2 
This assignment is split into 3 parts where each parts invovles some data structures and algorithms problems.

part 1 student is expected to write a heap tree 

part 2 student derives a variant of DAG using whatever algorithms to compute the shortest path

part 3 student are expected to come up with rotations  for binary search tree .
